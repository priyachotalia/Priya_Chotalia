Portfolio 1 is about analysing the cycling data. There are 2 datasets; Strava and Cheetah. Strava is a log of every ride since the start of 2018 and contains summary data like the distance and average speed and Cheetah provides some analytics services over ride data.
After reading strava and cheetah dataset, next tast was to merge the two data sets so we could get some similar rows and columns. 
The distplot of Average Heart Rate vs Average Power data shows us that higher the Average Heart Rate, the more power the cyclist exerted.
Average Speed vs Average Power gives us information that higher the power, the faster the bike will be. The pairplot of averagre heart rate, average power and average speed with respect to workout shows that the values of Workout is almost aligned with Ride and Race values. 

Portfolio 2 is the most interesting one as it is about analysing COVID19 data. Analysing the data about covid19 confirmed, deaths and recovered cases all over the globe. Since there are more then 100 counteries in the data, I have extracted and analyse the top countires like USA, Australia, UK, China and Italy. There are three main graphs in the portfolio. First is about the confirmed cases in USA, Australia, UK, China and Italy. It is clear from the graph that USA has highest number of cases. Whereas china has highest number of recovered cases. 

Portfolio 3 is about making a model to predict the genre of different books. Dataset from CMU Book Summaries Corpus has been provided which containes different columns such as ID, author name, title summary and genre. There are total 227 different genres in this dataset. But to make it easier, only top 5 genres have been considered which are Children's literature, science Fiction, Novel, Fantasy, Mystery. To make is more easier for prediction, all the 5 genres has been given a unique ID such as 0,1,2,3,4 repsectively. The model is not 100% accurate as it cannot predict some of the genres correctly.
